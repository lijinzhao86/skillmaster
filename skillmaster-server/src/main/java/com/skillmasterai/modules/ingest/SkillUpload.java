/**
 * A validated upload, ready to be published. M5's output and M7's input.
 *
 * @param name           the frontmatter {@code name}, also the skill's directory name
 * @param title          the frontmatter {@code title}, falling back to the name
 * @param description    the frontmatter {@code description} — required, and the search hot path
 * @param version        the frontmatter {@code version}, validated as a semver, or <strong>null
 *                       when the author declared none</strong> — which is a valid submission: the
 *                       version is then addressable only by digest (ADR 0033). Not a field of the
 *                       Agent Skills standard, which is why it is optional and why it travels
 *                       through the frontmatter copy untouched as well
 * @param frontmatter    every frontmatter field as parsed, unknown ones included, to be stored
 *                       verbatim. Dropping unknown fields is how the baseline lost Feishu's
 *                       nested {@code metadata.requires.bins} (§3.3 point 4).
 * @param files          every file of the skill, {@code SKILL.md} included — the manifest of §1.3
 *                       lists SKILL.md alongside the attachments, so it is not special-cased out
